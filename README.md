# March Madness Tournament Simulator

A sophisticated Python-based simulator that predicts the outcomes of the NCAA March Madness tournament using advanced statistical modeling and probability calculations.

## Features

- **Advanced Statistical Modeling**: Uses team ratings, offensive/defensive efficiency, tempo, and coaching factors
- **Comprehensive Simulation**: Runs 1,000,000 simulations for accurate predictions
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides probabilities for each team reaching different tournament stages
- **Score Prediction**: Predicts game scores based on team statistics
- **Bracket Visualization**: Generates a complete predicted bracket
- **Championship Analysis**: Analyzes potential championship game matchups and scoring outcomes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/march-madness-simulator.git
cd march-madness-simulator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulator:
```bash
python simulator.py
```

The program will:
1. Run 1,000,000 tournament simulations
2. Display probabilities for each team reaching different stages
3. Generate a complete predicted bracket
4. Analyze potential championship game scenarios

## How It Works

The simulator uses several key components:

1. **Team Statistics**: Each team is rated based on:
   - Overall rating
   - Offensive efficiency
   - Defensive efficiency
   - Experience factor
   - Coaching factor

2. **Win Probability Calculation**: Uses a weighted formula considering:
   - Overall team strength
   - Offensive/defensive capabilities
   - Experience and coaching factors

3. **Game Simulation**: Simulates individual games using probability calculations

4. **Tournament Simulation**: Runs complete tournament simulations to generate probabilities
